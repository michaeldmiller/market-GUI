# Market Simulator

By Michael D. Miller

Market simulator is a dynamic, ground-up microeconomic engine, which uses autonomous agents
interacting in a virtual marketplace to model real-world economic forces and behaviors.
It features a customized market creation screen, which allows users to fine tune the exact
parameters of the simulation to their needs, as well as a preset to begin simulation immediately.

Within the simulation, there are a number of live graphing utilities and display buttons
to explore and analyze the properties of your virtual market.
